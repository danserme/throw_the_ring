This project was done during course at Politecnico di Milano by prof. Paolo Perego. 

Throw the ring is a known game for kids that I have decided to digitalise. 

The prototype contains the ProtoPie app and physical toy (Arduino based), both are connected and exchange the data. 
For linking the toy and ProtoPie app I used Android smartphone with Bridge app installed by Paolo Perego, the toy was connected via USB to the smartphone.

User has to throw the rings on towers and the score will show up on the screen of app.
