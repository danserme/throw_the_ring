This is a known game for kids that I have decided to digitalise. The prototype contains the ProtoPie app and physical toy, both are connected and exchange the data. User has to throw the rings on towers and the score will show up on the screen of app. For video preview follow this link: https://youtu.be/hf70trUCpd8. For the last  ProtoPie app follow this link: https://cloud.protopie.io/p/3994ad14c5.
